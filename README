Sky Runner
-------------
Sky Runner is an engaging 2D endless runner game where the player controls a character running through the sky, avoiding obstacles and collecting points. With dynamic gameplay, players must jump and dodge obstacles while the difficulty increases as they score higher. The game features intuitive controls, particle effects, and a hand gesture-based pause mechanism using a webcam.

Features
-------------
Endless Runner: The player controls the character who runs through the sky while avoiding obstacles.
Hand Gesture Controls: Pause the game using two hands and resume using one hand. Jump by opening the hand (thumb and pinky wide apart).
Dynamic Obstacles: Obstacles that increase in speed as the player progresses through the levels.
Particle Effects: The game features particle effects triggered by the player's jump, adding a visually engaging experience.
Level System: The game becomes more challenging as the player progresses through levels by scoring more points.
Cloud Animation: Moving clouds enhance the atmosphere of the game.
Game Over Screen: Displays when the player collides with an obstacle, and provides an option to restart or quit.
Technologies Used
---------------------
Python: The programming language used to develop the game.
Pygame: For game development, including rendering, event handling, and user interaction.
OpenCV: Used to capture and process webcam video for detecting hand gestures.
MediaPipe: For hand tracking, enabling gesture-based controls such as jumping and pausing the game.
